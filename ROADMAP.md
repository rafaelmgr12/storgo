# Roadmap for Storgo

Storgo is a fully distributed, content-addressable, decentralized file storage system. Below is an extended roadmap to guide the development and improvement of the system.

## 1. Configuration Management

- [ ] **Implement Dynamic Configuration Management**
  - Use tools like `viper` or `envconfig` to manage configuration files.
  - Load configurations dynamically from YAML, TOML, environment variables, or CLI flags.
  - Implement support for multiple environments (development, staging, production).
  - Provide a fallback mechanism for missing configurations.
  - **New**: Add hot-reload of configurations without restarting services.

## 2. API and Communication

- [ ] **Add REST API or gRPC Endpoints**
  - Implement a REST API using `net/http` or gRPC for binary protocol communication.
  - Define API routes for external services to interact with the system (upload, download, delete, list files, etc.).
  - **New**: Implement a WebSocket API for real-time communication between nodes and clients.
  - Ensure secure authentication and authorization for API usage.
  - **New**: Add versioning to the API for backward compatibility with future changes.

## 3. CLI Improvements

- [ ] **Enhance the CLI Interface**
  - Use `cobra` to extend the CLI’s functionality by adding more commands and flags.
  - Add support for commands that allow users to manage configurations (set, update, view).
  - Add commands for file management (upload, download, delete), node management, and system health checks.
  - **New**: Implement interactive CLI mode where users can explore system status and run commands in real time.
  - Ensure CLI is capable of managing distributed nodes, displaying logs, and providing feedback about the network.

## 4. Docker and Deployment

- [ ] **Dockerize the Application**
  - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application and ensure consistency across environments.
  - Set up `docker-compose` to allow for easy setup and running of services in a local development environment.
  - Ensure Docker setup is optimized for production, staging, and development environments.
  - **New**: Add support for Kubernetes deployments, including Helm charts for orchestrating multiple nodes in a cluster.
  - **New**: Implement rolling updates and blue/green deployments to minimize downtime.

## 5. Service Discovery Using Distributed Hash Table (DHT)

- [ ] **Implement Service Discovery with DHT**
  - Implement a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) mechanism for peer-to-peer service discovery.
  - Use libraries like `Kademlia` or `libp2p` for the DHT.
  - Ensure nodes can discover and communicate autonomously via the DHT without centralized coordination.
  - **New**: Add monitoring and visualization tools for DHT to understand the health of the distributed network.
  - Add fault tolerance and redundancy in the DHT design, ensuring system operation even if nodes go offline.

## 6. File Storage Features

- [ ] **Content-Addressable Storage**
  - Ensure all files stored in the system are identified by a unique content hash.
  - Implement mechanisms to prevent duplication of files (deduplication) by storing files only once and referencing them by their hash.
  - **New**: Add support for different storage backends (local filesystem, S3, Azure Blob Storage, IPFS).
  - **New**: Implement chunking of large files into smaller pieces for efficient storage and transfer across nodes.
  
## 7. Data Encryption and Security

- [ ] **Add End-to-End Encryption**
  - Implement client-side encryption so that files are encrypted before they are uploaded and decrypted only after download.
  - **New**: Use AES-256 for symmetric encryption and RSA for asymmetric encryption to provide robust security for file transfers.
  - Implement encryption at rest for files stored on nodes.
  - **New**: Ensure files can be accessed only by authorized users, with key-based access controls.

## 8. Fault Tolerance and Replication

- [ ] **Implement Data Replication**
  - Add support for automatic replication of files across multiple nodes to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.
  - Implement replication policies that allow users to define how many replicas should be maintained for each file.
  - **New**: Add support for erasure coding to store files more efficiently by splitting them into fragments with redundancy across nodes.
  - **New**: Implement self-healing mechanisms where lost or corrupted files are automatically recovered from replicas.

## 9. Performance Optimizations

- [ ] **Optimize Data Transfer Speeds**
  - Add support for parallel uploads and downloads to speed up data transfer between nodes.
  - **New**: Implement compression algorithms (such as Gzip or Brotli) to reduce the size of files before transfer.
  - **New**: Use connection pooling and caching to optimize communication between nodes and clients.
  
## 10. Monitoring and Logging

- [ ] **Implement Centralized Logging**
  - Add centralized logging to gather logs from all distributed nodes in one location for easier debugging and system monitoring.
  - **New**: Integrate tools like `Prometheus` and `Grafana` for real-time monitoring of the system’s performance.
  - **New**: Implement alerts for key performance metrics (e.g., node downtime, file transfer failures, replication status).
  
## 11. Governance and Incentives (Optional for Decentralized Systems)

- [ ] **Implement a Governance Model**
  - Research and implement a decentralized governance model where nodes vote on system changes and upgrades.
  - **New**: Add support for incentive mechanisms, such as token rewards, to incentivize participation in the network (storage providers and consumers).
  - **New**: Add a reputation system where nodes gain or lose reputation based on their performance (uptime, speed, etc.).

## 12. Documentation and Community

- [ ] **Improve Documentation**
  - Provide thorough documentation for developers, including setup instructions, API documentation, and usage examples.
  - **New**: Add user-friendly guides for setting up a node and participating in the decentralized network.
  - **New**: Create a developer guide for contributing to the project, including code standards, branching strategy, and code review process.

## 13. Testing and Continuous Integration

- [ ] **Implement Unit and Integration Testing**
  - Ensure comprehensive unit tests are in place for critical system components.
  - Add integration tests to verify communication between distributed nodes and the overall stability of the system.
  - **New**: Set up Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to automate testing and deployment on each pull request.
  - **New**: Implement stress testing to simulate large-scale network scenarios and ensure the system can handle significant traffic.

## 14. P2P Network Enhancements

- [ ] **Extend Handshake Protocol**
  - The `handshake.go` file seems to implement a basic handshake mechanism. Enhance it by adding more robust validation and authentication during peer connection establishment.
  - Add encryption support during handshake using SSL/TLS or similar to ensure secure peer connections.
  - Implement peer verification mechanisms to prevent malicious peers from joining the network.

- [ ] **Improve Message Encoding**
  - The `encoding.go` file handles encoding for P2P communication. Consider adding support for more efficient binary serialization formats like **Protocol Buffers** or **Cap’n Proto** to improve performance.
  - Add versioning to the message format to ensure backward compatibility as the protocol evolves.

- [ ] **Transport Layer Enhancements**
  - The `tcp_transport.go` and `transport.go` files handle P2P transport. Add support for multiple transport protocols (e.g., UDP, QUIC) to improve flexibility and performance, especially in high-latency networks.
  - Implement **reliable delivery** and **packet loss recovery** mechanisms for P2P communication to ensure file transfer integrity.
  - Consider adding **connection pooling** and reuse to optimize network performance, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.

- [ ] **Network Health Monitoring**
  - Implement network health monitoring features that can provide statistics on peer connection status, latency, and bandwidth usage.
  - Add diagnostic tools to the CLI that allow users to monitor P2P network activity (e.g., active peers, connection stability).

- [ ] **Peer Reputation and Blacklisting**
  - Implement a peer reputation system that tracks the reliability of each peer in terms of availability, data accuracy, and response time.
  - Add mechanisms to **blacklist** or ban peers that exhibit malicious behavior, preventing them from connecting to the network.

- [ ] **P2P Test Coverage**
  - Improve test coverage for the `tcp_transport.go` file, and ensure the testing suite is comprehensive for different network conditions (latency, packet loss, etc.).
  - Add **integration tests** to simulate real-world P2P scenarios, including network partitioning and peer failure recovery.
